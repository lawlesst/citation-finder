# Citation finder

This is a demo application that uses the [CrossRef](http://crossref.org/) [metadata search api](http://search.crossref.org/) to resolve free text citations to DOIs.  If a citation is resolved, it is then sent off to a library [OpenURL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL) resolver to locate the online, full-text location of the item.
